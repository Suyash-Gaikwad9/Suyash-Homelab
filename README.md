# Suyash's Homelab 🚀  

## **🚧 Currently in Progress 🚧**  
This repository documents my self-hosted homelab setup, where I experiment with **server management, networking, and self-hosting applications**.

## **🎯 Objectives**  
- Host my own services (**Git, Web Apps, Databases, etc.**)  
- Learn and practice **Linux server management & networking**  
- Automate deployments using **GitOps, scripting & Ansible**  
- Secure my homelab with **SSL, VPNs, and monitoring**
